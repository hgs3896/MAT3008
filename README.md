# Numerical Analysis

1. #### [Find the machine epsilon of floating-point number](Homework%20%231/Homework1.md)

   - Method 1: using 'machar' function in NA library
   - Method 2: calculating eps by finding the largest positive integer n that satisfies 1 + 2^(-n) != 1

   

2. #### [Compare the root finding algorithms learned during the class](Homework%20%232/Homework2.md)

   #### in terms of their convergence speeds measured by the number of steps required to stop iterations

   To compare them,

      - Bessel Function

      - y = e^(-x)*cos(x)

   were used.

   

3. #### [Solve the linear systems or calculate inverse/determinant of an matrix using one of methods below](Homework%20%233/Homework3.md)

   - Gauss-Jordan Elimination
   - LU Decomposition
   - Singular Value Decomposition
   - Iterative Approach



4. #### [Programming on random number generation](Homework%20%234/Homework4.md)

   Generating psuedo-random numbers using the modular of a prime number,
   approximate the uniform distribution or some meaningful distribution(normal).

   

5. #### [Upscale the image using bilinear interpolation upto 3x of its size](Homework%20%235/Homework5.md)

   Using vectorization of **numpy**, it works much faster.

   

6. ##### [Data fitting](Homework%20%236/Homework6.md)

   Implemented the General Linear Least Square
